# Unreal Space Program

This repository is a modification of the
[jsbsim/UnrealEngine](https://github.com/jsbsim-team/jsbsim) unreal engine
example project with JSBSim to provide a playground for realistic rocket
simulation. A useful reference I followed when extending this project is the
original post by Epic Games: [A DIY Flight Simulator
Tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/mmL/a-diy-flight-simulator-tutorial).
